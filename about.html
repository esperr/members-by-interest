		<h2>Why Members by Interest?</h2>
    <p>Members of congress vary in many ways, from their background to their party to the types of areas they represent.
    Another important difference is that each member has their own set of personal interests that they bring to their work.</p>
    <p>One member may be very interested in farming, while another concerns herself primarily with foreign affairs. It is possible to guess at some of these interests by looking at
    geographical region or committee assignments, but a more direct route is to examine the <em>types</em> of bills that an individual member sponsors and
    cosponsors. This is useful information not only to observers of congress, but also for citizens who are especially concerned with a given issue.</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Analysts from the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/about/">Congressional Research Service</a> look at each bill and resolution and assign them terms from two controlled vocabularies:
      <a href="https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/policy-area">Policy Area terms</a> and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/legislative-subject-terms">
      Legislative Subject Terms</a>. The former is a broad overview of the topic of a bill (only one heading is assigned), while the latter is much more granular, though less
      easy to browse.</p>
    <p>Using the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/BILLSTATUS">bulk bill status system</a>, individual bills are downloaded. Then their subject and policy terms are extracted
      and matched to member(s) sponsoring and cosponsoring each bill. The resulting data is displayed in two ways &emdash; first it is shown as ranked list of members for each subject.
      Alternately, the user can choose to view an individual member and see the distribution of topics that they are engaged with graphed on a chart.</p>
      <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>For the sake of simplicity, only committees (and not subcommittees) are shown on the diagrams. As bill status data is manually downloaded, activity for the most recent congress may be slightly out-of-date.<p>
