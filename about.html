		<h2>Why Members by Interest?</h2>
    <p>Members of congress vary in many ways, from their background, to their party, to the types of areas they represent.
    Another important difference is that each member has their own set of personal interests that they bring to their work.</p>
    <p>One member may be very interested in farming, while another concerns herself primarily with foreign affairs. It is possible to guess at some of these interests by looking at
    geographical region or committee assignments, but a more direct route is to examine the <em>types</em> of bills that an individual member sponsors and
    cosponsors. This is useful information to have, not only to observers of congress, but also for citizens who are especially concerned with a given issue.</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Analysts from the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/about/">Congressional Research Service</a> look at each bill and resolution and assign them terms from two controlled vocabularies:
      <a href="https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/policy-area">Policy Area terms</a> and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/legislative-subject-terms">
      Legislative Subject Terms</a>. The former is a broad overview of the topic of a bill (only one heading is assigned), while the latter is much more granular.</p>
    <p>Using the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/BILLSTATUS">bulk bill status system</a>, information about individual bills are downloaded. Then their subject and policy terms are extracted
      and matched to member(s) sponsoring and cosponsoring each bill. The resulting data is displayed in two ways &mdash; either as a ranked list of members for a given subject, or a graph
      showing what an individual member is most uniquely engaged with.</p>
    <h3><a id="howtoadjust"></a>Adjusted Score</h3>
    <p>Bills can only have one sponsor, so being that sponsor is a strong indication that one is engaged with the topic(s) addressed by that measure. By contrast, bills may have many cosponsors, some
      (<em>original</em> cosponsors) who are noted at the time of introduction and may have had influence on the language of a measure, and others who join along the way before it leaves the committee process.

      <p>For this reason, an "adjusted score" is used to rank the influence of a given member on a particular measure. Members receive three points for sponsoring a bill, two points for being an orignal cosponsor and a single point
      for being a cosponsor. It is these adjusted scores that are added together to rank members by a given subject. They are also used to
        compare the level of a member's engagement with a topic to the number of bills introduced that address that topic. </p>
    <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>Bill status data in the format used by Members by Interest currently only exists for the 113th congress onwards. Many current members may have served earler, but activity before the 113th will not be reflected here.</p>
        <p>Bill statuses are downloaded and analyzed once per day, so counts for today may lag until then. No attempt is made to independently analyze the "aboutness" of a given bill aside from the headings
          assigned by CRS.<p>
